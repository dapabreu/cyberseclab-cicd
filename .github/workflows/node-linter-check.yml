# This is the name of your workflow
name: Node.js CI Check

# This controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on pull requests targeting the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs
jobs:
  # This job is named "lint-code"
  lint-code:
    # The type of virtual machine (runner) to run the job on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository's code
      # "uses" tells the job to use a pre-built action from the marketplace
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the Node.js environment
      - name: Use Node.js 20
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          # "with" is how you provide parameters to an action
          node-version: 20
          # This speeds up dependency installation
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        # "npm ci" is a "clean install" command, faster and safer for CI
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run the linter
      # This runs the "lint" script defined in your package.json
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint
